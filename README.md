#### How many Team Members were there?

There were a total of 3 Team Members.

#### My Role

Patient Viewpoint

#### Aim of Instant Health

The aim of Instant Health was to have all health related visits - Emergency Room, Dental Cleaning, Primary Care Doctor etc.-available for the patient to view at any time.

How often do people forget when their last dental cleaning was when they swap over to another Dentist? Last time they had blood work done?

This is is where Instant Health comes in.

#### Special Note

My team and I made it through the first round of judging and concluded with being in the Top 4 of the 20-30 teams competing in the Healthcare Category.

#### What is the problem and how does Instant Health solve it?

Problem: Patients are not able to remember when was the last time they had a dental cleaning when they switch dentists or when they last had blood work done when they switch doctors.

Instant Health Solution: Instant Health allows for patients to view their Health History at any time. Primary Care Doctors, Dentists, ER Doctors etc. are also able to use Instant Health to view previous health related issues, pertinent to their field, of the patient they are seeing.

#### Visualizing Our Solution
Our first step was to make a Wireframe of the flow for Instant Health. We knew there needed to be a Health Professional viewpoint to insert Patient Data into the database and a Patient viewpoint for Patients to view their Health History. To ensure both options were viewed on the homepage, we decided to create two buttons on the Home Page: Login As Patient & Login As Doctor.

Above is the Prototype I created for the Patient viewpoint based on the wireframe we sketched. If the Patient already has an account set up, they just have to enter their email and password to access their Health History. If they do not have an account, they must enter the key provided to to them by their Primary Care Doctor, and their email and password they would like to associate their account with.

As we were running short on time, we decided to forego making personas.
 
#### What do Health Professionals see when they login?
When a Health Professional logs in, they are shown two options: Search for a specific patient or add a new patient. If a Primary Care Doctor were to search for a specific patient by last name, and they are the Primary Care Doctor for multiple members of the family, the list of family members will appear. The doctor will then select the patient’s file they would like to view.

If they were add A New Patient an auto-generated key would be provided, and they would have to insert the Patient’s information into the system (i.e. First Name, Last Name, Address, Social Security Number, Insurance etc.). they must only able to see information that is relevant to their field - i.e. If a Doctor was are unable to see the dentist records of the patient.

#### What happens if a Health Professional does not have an account?

If a Health Professional does not have an account they must register their practice with Instant Health and await an email confirmation that they have successfully been approved to create an account.

#### Can a Primary Care Doctor view a Patient’s Dentist History?
No, the Health Professional is only able to see information that is relevant to their field. A Primary Care Doctor is only able to view a Patient’s past Medical history.
